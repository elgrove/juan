# Juan

Juan is a Django-based webapp designed for the minimalist traveler. Inspired by the [onebag](https://reddit.com/onebag) community on Reddit, it focuses on the philosophy of traveling light and efficiently with just 'juan' bag.

I appreciate that the UI is a little spartan and needs some work, but the app is functional as-is and I have begun using it to plan packing lists for trips. It's great for remembering what to take when I visit my parents, and what I don't because I keep one there.
